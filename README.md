###  Introduction
<p align="justify">Multi-label land cover classification is less explored compared to single-label classification.
In contrast, multi-label classification is more realistic as we always find out multiple land cover in each image.
However, with the Deep learning applications and Convolutional Neural Networks, we can tackle the challenge of multilabel classifications.</p>

<p align="justify">We use the redesigned Multi-label UC Merced dataset with 17 land cover classes. UC Merced Land use dataset was
initially introduced as one of the earliest satellite datasets for computer vision, and considered as the MNIST of satellite imagery.
